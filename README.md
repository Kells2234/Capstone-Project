## Overview

As the population ages and life expectancy increases, the senior care industry, specifically the skilled nursing facility sector, has emerged as a consistent investment choice for numerous investors. Despite facing challenges such as the impact of Covid and persistent staffing shortages, investors—particularly those in private equity—recognize a growing value in nursing home portfolios.

The central question arises: can skilled nursing facilities not only recover from challenges but also thrive in the future? Is this industry poised to remain a steadfast component of investment portfolios? This project aims to conduct a comprehensive examination of the senior care industry, delving into its current state and future prospects.

The primary focus is on identifying the optimal areas for investment. This involves assessing which states or cities offer the most promising opportunities. The report will leverage population demographics to project growth in specific regions, considering various market factors that could influence these markets either positively or negatively. While industry reports on skilled nursing facilities abound, this project distinguishes itself by providing granular state-level information, enabling more targeted and informed investment decisions.
